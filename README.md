# Text-Mining-Project
Extracted Iphone X reviews from amazon and done text analytics on the extracted data. 

The text from Ipnone X has been analyzed using various business analytics techniques such as Word Cloud using Term Frequency (TF) &  TF Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) including unigram, Sentiment analysis, Semantic networks, Cluster Dendrogram, Unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering), Association rules etc.

The following are a few key inferences taken from the wordclouds, dendrograms and clusters :

   (1)	Key words standing out of the rest are battery, touch, clarity, life, fast  etc. 

   (2)	These words should be seen in the context to gain business value

   (3) When we see this word cloud in conjunction with dendrogram, we notice that poor battery, smooth touch, fast os etc.

   (4)	Semantic network shows that the relationship between the words & the key themes mentioned in previous slide are becoming relevant

   (5)	One key thing is low light. At the first sight it sounds as if the diplay is bad, but when we see it in context we get a clear idea about it as it was  saying that "great pic quality even in low light on the iphone x camera"

   (6) Scree-plot or elbow plot shows that there is a clear bend at 2 clusters, hence we are considering that there are 2 clusters (categories) that the data can be segregated into.

   (7)	Word cloud is clearly highlighting that this cluster is speaking majorly about camera and display.

   (8)	Even the dendrogram clearly shows camera and display as a major cluster.
